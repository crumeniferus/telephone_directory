Telephone Directory for James Smith

Telephone numbers must be in telephone_data.csv and must not use any features of a spreadsheet that do not belong in a basic CSV file, such as cell formatting.

Column order in telephone_data.csv must be "Old Memory", "Memory", "Name", "Number", "Notes" "Cross reference", "Programmed", "Tested".

Old Memory
----------

"Old Memory" is a quick reference to aid transition from the old sytem to the new one and is likely to be removed in future versions.

Memory
------

"Memory" is the quick code for the new telephone system.

Name
----

In the "Name" column, add in brackets any words which do not really belong in the main title but which will help with indexing, e.g. contact's name, "mobile", business category such as "Florists".

Number
------

"Number" can be entered exactly as you would dial it. Do not use the spreadsheet's functions to make the "0" appear at the beginning as this formatting will be dealt with in the printing stage. Also, apostrophes are the most usual such mark in spreadsheets, and this punctuation mark has a special meaning in all programming languages.

Notes
-----

"Notes" should be very brief, e.g. "Has answer phone".

Cross reference
---------------

In the "Cross reference" column, give one entry that would make sense in a "See also" sentence. In most versions of the printed phone lists, this will be printed just beneath the main entry as "See also <your text here>". Do not use spreadsheet functions to link to other entries. Functions are not compatible with CSV files, and at best will result in the formula itself being printed as a cross reference. Instead, write out the cross-reference in full.

Programmed and Tested
---------------------

The "Programmed" and "Tested" fields are for technical use and generally do not appear on most versions of the phone list. Nevertheless, they need to be in the positions stated above.
